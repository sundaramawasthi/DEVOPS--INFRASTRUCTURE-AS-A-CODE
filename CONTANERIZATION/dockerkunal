Introduction

For a beginner appliation are running on a server .So idea is that application is running on server .
Inial application are running on application only one application on one server
one server for one application , suppoese 200 people use the application but when people incese load also
incese , so they dont the way to run multiple application on server.
so for new application buy a new server .

Every time when need to new app we have to buy new server.

VMVARE -
VM ware solve this problem by virtual machine .
VM machine solve one application on one server problem , you xan run multiple application on same server . but vm required their own OS.
ITs far better than one application on one server but not so good.

PROBLEM IN VM WARE -
VM need on OS

build an application and give website to friend but when your frieds run it not run on their machine.
its saying module, machine , are machine .

Shift one code one point to another then migration are consuming .

The problem is being solve by Container .

HISTORY OF CONTAINER/DOCKER -
These company like google and open source they Contribuated toword container related technology on linux kernel and after that docker came. easy to other folk use linux container.

DOCKER -

DOCKER is helping us to run application on isolated enviroment.

DOCKER CONTAIN THE FEW pART -

orchistration
engine
runtime

the docker runitime -
runtime allow us to start and stop container .
Run time are of two type

1. low level runtype RUN C { its work on os and stop and start container}
2. CoNTAINER D { help to container , how to push data, pull images and all staf used for container D also it manage the run c, conecting data , etc. }
